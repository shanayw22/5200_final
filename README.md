🌍 Global Energy Trends: A 50-Year Perspective

DSAN5200 Project – Group 29
Contributors: Shanay Wadhwani, Ihsan Alaeddin, Manav Arora

📌 Project Overview

This project investigates how global energy consumption has evolved over the past 50 years, with a focus on differences across countries based on development status. We explore trends in energy mix, CO2 emissions by sector, and the relationship between emissions, energy usage, and economic growth.

Our goal is to equip policymakers, researchers, and the general public with interactive tools and insights to better understand energy transitions, identify vulnerabilities, and support data-driven climate policy.

🧠 Key Research Questions
	1.	Energy Mix by Development Status
	•	How do energy patterns differ between developed and developing countries?
	•	Which countries rely most on fossil fuels vs. renewables?
	2.	CO2 Emissions by Sector
	•	How do emissions vary by economic sector and region?
	•	What role do national energy policies play?
	3.	Emissions & Economic Growth
	•	Have developed nations decoupled emissions from GDP growth?
	•	How has this relationship changed over the decades?

🛠️ Analytical Approach

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Time-series trends of energy consumption and emissions
	•	Geospatial analysis to highlight disparities across countries
	•	Identification of outliers, inconsistencies, and missing values

✅ Statistical & Machine Learning Methods
	•	Regression analysis to examine relationships between variables
	•	Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group countries by energy profile
	•	Forecasting using ARIMA and Prophet

✅ Visualization & Dashboarding
	•	Interactive dashboards using Plotly/Dash
	•	Geospatial maps using GeoPandas/Folium
	•	Scrollytelling narratives via Quarto with Reveal.js

⸻

📊 Sample Visualizations
	•	Choropleth maps of per capita energy usage
	•	Sectoral CO2 emissions bar charts
	•	Line plots of energy-GDP trends over time
	•	Animated maps of energy transitions
